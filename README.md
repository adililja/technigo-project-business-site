# Business Site

The assigment was to build a website for any buisness. Building in html, designing and made fully responsive with css and also including a form with inputs so that a user can send information. The information should be sent to httpbin.org/anything.

This is a website for a company in Sweden that helps other oragisations and projects to get of their feet and/or realize ideas. They mainly work within the culture sector and have experience financing and curating music-festivals and other events.

I started out desining the mobile layout on paper and went by constructing from header to footer. After that I made the page responsive mainly by chaning the layout of the business information to fit tablet respective a landscape layout.

In more time, I would:

-   Make a small logo go to the tab in browser
-   Fix some hover-transitions
-   Make the navbar linked and working
-   Improve slideshow with JavaScript
